                <p class="lead mb-5">Being a non-binary Black trans woman, where there only 3% of women employed in the tech sector that fall into this lived experience, I would like to attract other people of the global majority and assist them in succeeding and achieving their goals is the primary drive of developer advocacy and activism that I employ. Care is essential for a thriving and organically growing community and culture; additionally, commitment to communication and continuous improvement bolsters morale, connectivity, and growth.</p>
