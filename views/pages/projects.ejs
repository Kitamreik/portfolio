    <!-- Display live web links whenever possible so readers can get an instant visual on your work with a simple click. Additionally, include graphics, GIFS, and even video demonstrations of your professional experience to generate excitement and interest with online viewers.  A coding portfolio should contain 4-10 projects.

These projects should demonstrate your skills, letting potential employers and recruiters know that you can do what your resume suggests. For this reason, it's important that your projects reflect the job you're aiming for.
Many coders include links to projects housed on GitHub or other development platforms. Professionals often use GitHub to show off current and ongoing projects, and public GitHub profiles allow potential employers to see code updates in real time.
